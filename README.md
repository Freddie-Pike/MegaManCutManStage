# MEGA MAN!

# Intro
This project is a recreation of the Cutman stage from Mega Man 1 done in Unity. This Github will contain the code for the latest version with comments which will hopefully make it easy
to read for anyone looking at this project. This project is purely for fun with no intention for resell, as all sprites and music belong
to Capcom.
